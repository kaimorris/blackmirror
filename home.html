					<h2>_____</h2>
					<p>In this world, a society of people live in an enormous, enclosed space with a video screen covering nearly every surface offering personalised entertainment. They earn their living by riding on exercise bikes in order to power their surroundings and generate currency known as Merits, which can be used to buy food, goods, virtual accessories for their Dopple, and to skip advertising that frequently interrupts everyday activities. Overweight people are considered second-class citizens, and either work as cleaners around the bikes (where they are verbally abused) or are humiliated on game shows.

					<h2>_____</h2>
					<p>Martha and Ash are a young couple who move to a remote house in the countryside. The day after moving into the house, Ash is killed while returning the hire van. After discovering she is pregnant, Martha reluctantly tries out a new online service that lets people stay in touch with the deceased. By using all of his past online communications and social media profiles, a new "Ash" can be created virtually. After starting out with instant messaging, Martha uploads videos and photos of Ash to the service's database, so that it can duplicate Ash's voice to talk to Martha over the phone. Martha allows herself to believe that she is talking to her dead partner...</p>
