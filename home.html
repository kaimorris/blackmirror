					<h1>S1E2</h1>
					<h2>_____</h2>
					<p>In this world, a society of people live in an enormous, enclosed space with a video screen covering nearly every surface offering personalised entertainment. They earn their living by riding on exercise bikes in order to power their surroundings and generate currency known as Merits, which can be used to buy food, goods, virtual accessories for their Dopple, and to skip advertising that frequently interrupts everyday activities. Overweight people are considered second-class citizens, and either work as cleaners around the bikes (where they are verbally abused) or are humiliated on game shows. 
					Bingham "Bing" Madsen has inherited 12,000,000 merits from his dead brother and has the luxury of skipping advertisements as often as he wants...</p><a href="fmf.html" class="a">View Clips</a></div>

					<h2>_____</h2>
					<p>A portion of society has implanted a "grain" behind their ear, which records everything they see and hear. Using a remote, a user can perform a "re-do", playing back their memories directly to their eye or to a video monitor. Young lawyer Liam Foxwell leaves a work appraisal that he felt went poorly. While returning home, he repeatedly watches the re-do, and is troubled by a seemingly insincere phrase from his employer. He meets his wife Ffion at a dinner party with friends, seeing her talk to a man he does not recognize. He introduces himself as Jonas. As the party continues, Liam becomes concerned that Ffion seems fond of Jonas, laughing at his crude jokes. When Liam and Ffion return home, he goads her into talking more about her history with Jonas. She admits...</p>

					<p>Martha and Ash are a young couple who move to a remote house in the countryside. The day after moving into the house, Ash is killed while returning the hire van. After discovering she is pregnant, Martha reluctantly tries out a new online service that lets people stay in touch with the deceased. By using all of his past online communications and social media profiles, a new "Ash" can be created virtually. After starting out with instant messaging, Martha uploads videos and photos of Ash to the service's database, so that it can duplicate Ash's voice to talk to Martha over the phone. Martha allows herself to believe that she is talking to her dead partner...</p>

					<h2>_____</h2>
					<p>A woman wakes up in a house and realizes she has amnesia. She is surrounded by images of a small girl whom she assumes is her daughterâ€”as well as photos of herself and a man and also by a television signal. She leaves the house and notices several people recording her on their phones who ignore her pleas for help. A masked man arrives and opens fire at her with a shotgun. She flees and meets Jem and Damien. Jem and the woman escape the masked man, who kills Damien. Jem explains that a mysterious signal began appearing on television and over the Internet, while most of the population turned into passive voyeurs who do nothing but record everything around them. The woman and Jem are unaffected, but they are also a target for the "hunters", unaffected humans who act sadistically...</p>

					<h2>_____</h2>
					<p>Society has adapted to technology where, through eye implants and mobile devices, everyone shares their daily activities and rates their interactions with others on a one-to-five star scale, and where one's current average rating can be seen by others and has significant influence on their societal status. Lacie Pound lives with her brother Ryan. Currently rated a 4.2, Lacie seeks to raise her rating to 4.5 in order to obtain a discount for a luxury apartment. Her attempts to be an outgoing and pleasant socialite do little to help. She talks to a consultant who suggests she try to gain favour from people with very high ratings, who have a larger impact on her score. Lacie takes a photograph of Mr. Rags, a teddy bear that she and her childhood friend Naomi made together. She is pleased when Naomi rates the photo highly, and then later calls her...</p>
